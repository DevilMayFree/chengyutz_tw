with various stakeholders in a multi-channel and open and transparent manner, so as to ensure that the concerns and expectations of various stakeholders can put the operational strategies and objectives of PlayNitride into account, and responds to stakeholders with substantive operating results, and then summarizes the communication channels with various important stakeholders in 2021 (as
